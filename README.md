# _Hi, I'm Risini Dinara Kumarasinghe._

_I'm currently pursuing a major in Electronic Engineering, specializing in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. I have a deep passion for mathematics and problem-solving, and I thrive in design, particularly in 3D modeling. I always strive to deliver the best in everything I do._

_One of my most significant achievements was securing 2nd place in the GCE O/L exam island-wide, competing against over 300,000 students. I also ranked 73rd in the island in the Physical Sciences stream, becoming the top-performing student in my school with the highest scores in Combined Mathematics and Physics._

_In my recent work, I've taken on the role of the lead designer in several projects, including "MeasureUP," "VeinFinder," and "Zero Gravity Lifting." My research interests lie in the application of mathematics in engineering._

_In my free time, I love feeding and cuddling pets. It’s a simple joy that gives me a break from my studies_
